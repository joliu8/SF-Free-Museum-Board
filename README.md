## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I encountered while building this app include making the button open a new window on click and styling my project with CSS. I was able to overcome these challenges with the help of GitHub Copilot, Stack Overflow, and online React and CSS guides. I also strugged with creating a GIF because I did not realize Imgur and GitHub both have file size restrictions.
